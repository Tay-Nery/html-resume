<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings, I'm Taynara Nery – thrilled to virtually meet you! I'm a Brazil-based Information System Student with 
  a huge will to practice and learn. First off, it's so nice of you to take a peek at my resume.
  Let me give you the lowdown on who I am and what, I hope, I could bring to the table.</p>

<p>Imagine someone who's not only learning to code with passion but also easily switching between French and Portuguese like
  it's a walk in the park. That's me! Plus, I've got quite a nice level in English too. 
  Communication gaps won't be an issue.
  I'm currently diving deep into the world of Information Systems, equipping myself with skills that range from coding to I hope, someday,
  creating interfaces that users will love. I'm the kind of person who stays up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques.</p>

<p>Another fact about me: I'm not bound by geography. I'am bsolutely up to work remotely if necessary.
  So, whether your team is across the city or across the world, count me in for a productive partnership.
  But hold on, there's more to me than just code. When I'm not busy learning to bring websites to life, you'll find me nose-deep in a book or leveling up in a game
  (MMORPG are my favourite kind). I also love to watch movies and TV Shows.
  Oh, and I have a not-so-secret passion for trying new reciepies and savoring craft beer. It's all about the little things.</p>

<p>Long story short, I'm Taynara Nery – a learner, coder, languages lover, and a believer. If you're looking for someone who's excited about working with web development,
   I'm your person. Feel free to reach out, and let's chat about how we could nicely work together.
  Cheers, Taynara Nery</p>
